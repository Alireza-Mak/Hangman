# About the Project: hangman
I created a Hangman game using Python, a classic word-guessing game that brings both fun and challenge. In this digital version, players must guess the hidden word by inputting individual letters, with each incorrect guess resulting in the gradual drawing of a hangman figure. The game is designed with a collection of words to choose from randomly, adding an element of unpredictability to each round. To make it more engaging, I included a visual representation of the hangman's progress, with each wrong guess leading to the drawing of a body part, such as the head, body, arms, and legs. The game continues until the player either successfully guesses the word or the hangman is fully drawn, resulting in a loss. It's a classic and entertaining game that tests vocabulary skills and quick thinking while providing hours of enjoyable gameplay.
